# MTB Brake Force Visualisation

A fun little project to visualise the brake force generated by different mountain bike braking systems. Also includes a custom brake builder for mixing and matching different levers with different calipers. The data is taken from a laborious forum thread on [Ridemonkey](https://ridemonkey.bikemag.com/threads/frankenbrakes-and-brake-improvement-discussion.274164/). Of course, this data is not 100% accurate, but it does give a good indication of the performance of different brakes.

If you have any data to add or correct, please post this on the Ridemonkey forum thread, or send me a message, and I'll make sure it gets added to the database.
