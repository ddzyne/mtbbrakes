      <h1>Mountain bike brake force visualisation</h1>
      <p>This tool takes brake pad and rotor material out of the equation and looks simply at the leverage ratio of different brakes. <strong>Hydraulic leverage</strong> is generated by the difference in surface area between the master cylinder in the lever and slave cylinders in the caliper. <strong>Mechanical leverage</strong> stems from the relation between a lever blade's length and its pivot point. <strong>Total leverage</strong> is the product of these two. Some brake levers use linkages that vary leverage. For these brakes, a <strong>peak leverage</strong> is provided.</p>
      <p><strong>Weights</strong> are taken from various online weight databases with photo verification. In an effort to equalise these data, length/type/weight of the hoses are taken out of the equation. Plastic hoses weigh around 0.02 g/mm, stainless steel braided hoses just under 0.06 g/mm.</p>
      <h5>Disclaimer</h5>
      <p className="small">The data is in no way complete, not guaranteed 100% accurate, and the mechanical leverage data has some caveats. There is no leverage curve calculated, so data are an estimated average, which may deviate from reality. Also, the mechanical leverage at the brake's contact point depends on the lever throw and vice versa, which is not taken into account. There is no lever throw data, which means that a mix & match brake might be theoretically powerful, but also unusable, with a lever throw well beyond the bars. Lever and caliper flex, and hence power loss, is also not taken into account.</p>
